# Network Protocol Attacks Lab – Summary

Network protocol attacks were conducted using Responder, Ettercap, and Wireshark. An SMB relay attack successfully captured NTLM authentication data, while ARP spoofing enabled Man-in-the-Middle interception of network traffic. The exercise highlights the risks of legacy authentication protocols, implicit trust, and lack of network-level security controls.
