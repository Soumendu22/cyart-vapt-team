# Non-Technical Summary  
## Capstone Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT)

This capstone Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) exercise was conducted to evaluate the security posture of a target environment by simulating realistic cyberattack scenarios in a controlled and ethical manner. The assessment followed a structured methodology to identify weaknesses across network services, system configurations, web and API components, and mobile application layers.

The testing revealed several security gaps, including misconfigured services, weak access controls, and insecure handling of sensitive data. While some vulnerabilities appeared moderate on their own, they could be combined to achieve deeper system compromise. Such weaknesses, if exploited in a real-world environment, may lead to unauthorized access, data leakage, service disruption, and reputational damage.

Based on the findings, key recommendations include timely patching, stronger access control enforcement, secure data storage practices, network hardening, and regular security monitoring. Overall, this capstone VAPT highlights the importance of proactive security testing in identifying and mitigating risks before they are exploited by malicious actors.
