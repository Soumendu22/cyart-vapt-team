# Privilege Escalation and Persistence Lab – Summary

Privilege escalation testing on a VulnHub virtual machine identified misconfigured SUID binaries using LinPEAS, which allowed escalation to root privileges. Persistence was established by configuring a cron job to maintain access after reboot. This lab demonstrates how improper permissions and weak system hardening can lead to complete system compromise.
