# Mobile Application Testing Lab – Summary

Mobile application security testing identified insecure data storage using MobSF during static analysis. Dynamic testing with Frida successfully bypassed authentication by hooking runtime functions, while Drozer revealed exposed IPC components. The lab demonstrates how weak client-side security and misconfigured Android components can lead to unauthorized access and sensitive data exposure.
