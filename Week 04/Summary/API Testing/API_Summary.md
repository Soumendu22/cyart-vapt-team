# API Security Testing Lab – Summary

The DVWA API was assessed for OWASP API Top 10 vulnerabilities using Burp Suite, Postman, and sqlmap. Critical Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) was identified by manipulating object IDs, allowing unauthorized data access. GraphQL injection was also detected, exposing backend schema details. These findings highlight weak authorization enforcement and insufficient input validation in API design.
