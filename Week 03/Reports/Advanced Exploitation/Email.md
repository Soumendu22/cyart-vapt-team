Dear Development Team,

During the recent penetration testing exercise on the DVWA application hosted at 10.49.140.160, a critical security issue was identified. A chained exploit involving Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), weak session management, and a customized exploit resulted in successful Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server. The attack was initiated by injecting a malicious JavaScript payload, which allowed session hijacking and subsequent execution of arbitrary commands via a Meterpreter payload from the attacker system (192.168.0.105).

Immediate remediation is recommended, including strict input sanitization, secure session handling, and timely patching of vulnerable components. Please review the detailed findings and remediation steps shared in the report.

Regards,
Soumendu Manna
