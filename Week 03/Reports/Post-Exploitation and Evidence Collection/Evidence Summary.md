## Evidence Collection Summary 

During post-exploitation, network traffic and system artifacts were collected to validate attacker activity and impact. Wireshark was used to capture HTTP traffic, and Meterpreter session logs were preserved. All evidence was securely stored, hashed using SHA-256, and documented with proper chain-of-custody procedures to ensure integrity and reproducibility.
