Subject: Critical Vulnerabilities Identified on Web Server (Action Required)

Dear Development Team,
During the recent vulnerability assessment, we identified multiple critical issues affecting host 192.168.0.106, including a confirmed Path Traversal vulnerability (CVE-2021-41773) and an exploitable SQL Injection flaw in the login module. A proof-of-concept demonstrates that an attacker can access restricted files and bypass authentication controls. These vulnerabilities pose an immediate risk of data exposure and system compromise.
Please prioritize patching Apache to the latest version, validating all SQL inputs, and reviewing server configurations. Let me know if you need assistance implementing the fixes.
Regards,
