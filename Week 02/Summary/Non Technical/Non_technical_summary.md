# 🔹 Non-Technical Summary (Executive Summary – 120 Words)

A complete security assessment was performed on the target systems to identify weaknesses that attackers could exploit. The evaluation showed several critical issues, including insecure login forms, weak server configurations, outdated software, and exposed services. These vulnerabilities allowed simulated attackers to access sensitive information, manipulate web content, and even gain remote control of the system.

The purpose of this testing was not to cause harm but to demonstrate how real-world attacks occur and help improve overall security. The findings highlight the need for better input validation, updated software patches, stronger credentials, and improved server configurations.
By implementing the recommended fixes and performing regular security scans, the organization can significantly reduce cyber risks and strengthen system defenses.
